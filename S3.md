NOTES:
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a highly scalable and versatile object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS)
•	Object Storage: S3 provide secure , durable, highly scalable object storage 
•	Scalable : S3 allows you to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on web at low cost
•	Simple : easy to use with simple interface
•	S3 Cannot be used to run an operating system or DB.
•	Unlimites storage : Total volume of data and number of object you can store is unlimited
•	Examples of S3 URL : https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-example-bucket/my-folder/my-file.jpg
 https://<bucket-name>.s3-<region>.amazonaws.com/<object-key>
•	Key Value Store: Key-The object name ( e.g., profile.jpg), 
    Value- The actual data which is made up of a sequence of bytes
    Version ID - Allows to store multiple versions of same object
    Metadata- Stores the information about content-type, last-modified etc.
•	The Amazon S3 API: provides developers with a set of RESTful web service interfaces to interact with S3 resources, such as creating and managing buckets, uploading and downloading objects, and setting permissions.
•	SDKs and Tools: AWS provides SDKs for various programming languages to simplify interactions with the S3 API, including:
• AWS SDK for Java
• AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)
• AWS SDK for JavaScript
• AWS SDK for .NET
• AWS CLI

QUE:
1.	What is AWS S3 and why do you need this?
    AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that offers scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It is used to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the web. It is essential for backup and restore, disaster recovery, data archiving, big data analytics, and content storage and distribution.


2.	How S3 differs from EBS?
    S3 is an object storage service that is accessible via the internet, designed for high availability and durability, and suitable for storing and retrieving any amount of data. EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a block storage service that provides persistent storage for EC2 instances and is accessible only from the attached EC2 instance. EBS is ideal for use cases requiring low-latency access to data, such as running a database.


3.	What are different storage classes?
    AWS S3 offers several storage classes to help optimize costs based on data access patterns:
    •	S3 Standard: For frequently accessed data.
    •	S3 Intelligent-Tiering: For data with unknown or changing access patterns.
    •	S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): For infrequently accessed data that requires rapid access when needed.
    •	S3 One Zone-IA: For infrequently accessed data stored in a single availability zone.
    •	S3 Glacier: For long-term archival with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
    •	S3 Glacier Deep Archive: For long-term archival with retrieval times of 12 hours or more.


4.	How is data organized in S3?
    Data in S3 is organized into buckets. Each bucket can contain an unlimited number of objects, and each object is stored with a unique key (filename). Buckets provide a way to organize and manage data at a high level.


5.	What is the maximum size of an object stored in S3?
    The maximum size of a single object that can be stored in S3 is 5 terabytes. However, for objects larger than 100 megabytes, it is recommended to use the multipart upload feature.


6.	How can you control the access to S3 storage?
    Access to S3 storage can be controlled using several methods:
    •	Bucket policies: Define access rules for the entire bucket.
    •	IAM policies: Assign permissions to users and groups within an AWS account.
    •	Access Control Lists (ACLs): Define granular access at the object level.
    •	S3 Access Points: Manage access to shared data sets.
    •	Block Public Access settings: Prevent public access to buckets and objects.


7.	What is versioning in S3 and why you would use it?
    Versioning in S3 allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket. It helps protect against accidental deletions and overwrites by enabling you to restore previous versions of objects. This is useful for data protection and recovery scenarios.


8.	How does AWS S3 ensure durability of data?
    AWS S3 ensures data durability by automatically storing copies of all objects across multiple devices in at least three geographically separated availability zones within an AWS region. S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability.



9.	What is a pre-signed URL in S3?
    A pre-signed URL in S3 is a URL that grants temporary access to an object to anyone who has the URL. You can generate a pre-signed URL using the AWS SDK or CLI, specifying an expiration time. This is useful for sharing private objects without making them publicly accessible.


10.	Can you use S3 to host a static website?
    Yes, you can use S3 to host a static website. By enabling static website hosting on your S3 bucket, you can serve static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files directly from S3. You can also configure custom error pages and redirection rules.


11.	How can you transfer the data into or out of AWS S3?
    Data can be transferred into or out of AWS S3 using several methods:
    •	AWS Management Console: For manual uploads and downloads.
    •	AWS CLI (Command Line Interface): For automated transfers using commands.
    •	AWS SDKs: For programmatic access and transfers.
    •	S3 Transfer Acceleration: For fast, secure transfers over long distances.
    •	AWS DataSync: For automated data transfers between on-premises storage and S3.
    •	AWS Snowball: For transferring large amounts of data physically using a secure storage appliance.
    •	Third-party tools and services: Various tools integrate with S3 for data transfer and synchronization.

12. What is access point in S3?


13. Sample S3 Bucket Policy for Public Read Access:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
        } ] }

14. How do you control access to an object in S3?
      	using ACL and bucket policy

15. What is life cycle management in S3? How to create life cycle rule?

16. How can I host staric website ? where is option on console?

17. Data Security in Amazon S3
    Amazon S3 provides robust data security mechanisms to protect your data at rest and in transit. Key features include server-side encryption, access control lists (ACLs), and bucket policies.
    Server-Side Encryption (SSE) : you can set default encryption on bucket to encrypt all 
    Access Control Lists (ACLs):
